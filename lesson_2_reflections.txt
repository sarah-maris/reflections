What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

To initialize a repository you use the command 'git init' in the directory where you want the repository.  Git then starts a repository but does not make an initial commit - you need to do that.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is a holding pen of items that are waiting to be part of a commit.  The reflect changes in items that are in the working directory but not yet reflected in the repository with a commit
