When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If you are working on more than one computer -e.g. desktop at home, laptop on the go, this is ideal.  I do some of my best coding on long airplane flights. Nothing else to do and no one to disturb me.  Also great for collaboration.  Others can contribute to the projecct and share their work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually gives you control over the project and your work flow.  You decide when to add the new changes vs. Git forcing them on you before you are ready to incorporate them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is a clone of an existing repository that you take ownership of. It reflects the history of the original repository but allows you to do your own thing going forward.
	A clone is a copy of repository including the full history of changes through commits
	A branch is a new path of changes.  It allows you to try new ideas without affecting the main development path until your changes are ready for prime time.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    This helps you figure out where you are in the process. Also great if you are working offline and can't get to the remote repository
